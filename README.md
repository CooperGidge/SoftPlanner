# SoftPlanner

SoftPlanner is a simple Java program for planning and tracking the progress of a project.

* Mark tasks as "to do."
* Mark tasks as "doing."
* Mark tasks as "done."
* Add, edit, delete, and move items.

## How to run

1. Download the `dist` folder.
2. Make sure inside the `dist` folder is a folder titled `lists`. If there isn't, create one.
3. Make sure inside the `list` folder are three text files, `DoingList.txt`, `DoneList.txt`, and `ToDoList.txt`. If there aren't, create them.
4. Run `SoftPlanner.jar`. For easy access, create a shortcut for this file on your desktop.

**Note #1:** The `lists` folder **outside** the `dist` folder is for development - for use of the program, you only need the `dist` folder and its contents.

**Note #2:** Keep all files in the `dist` folder together. They need to be in the same folder in order to work properly.

**Note #3:** Remember that NetBeans may overwrite any data in the `dist` folder if you are using the IDE. This shouldn't be a problem if you're not using the IDE though.
